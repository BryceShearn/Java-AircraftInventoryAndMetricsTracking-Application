## Jets Project

### Description

* This project is designed to read a text file containing information on different aircraft to include Type, Model, Speed, Range, and Price.
* Once the information is received a menu containing options to
-List the fleet
-Fly all Jets
-View the fastest Jet
-simulated event of loading cargo planes
-simulated event of preparing for a dogfight
-add jets to the fleet
-remove jets from the fleet
-Quit

### Topics and Technologies Used

* Advanced for loops
* switches calling methods from other class files
* UML diagrams
* Abstract classes
* Buffered Readers and file readers
* String builders
* Super classes
* Exceptions handling
* Encapsulation, Polymorphism
* Array Lists, arrays
* Parsing
### How to Run


* run JetApplication.java while ensuring other src files are attached, no additional parameters are required.
* user is prompted with a menu upon program run prompting for a selection of menu items that will execute upon keyboard input and return the desired selections output. To exit the program after completion press 9.

### Lessons Learned

* During this project I took the time to design thoroughly laying out classes with desired results and created a UML diagram that painted a clear path towards my end goal. I learned the importance of design and how a little work before-hand can lead to a clean, thoroughly executed project. Along with this I also learned how clear, organized, and managed a program can be when divided by relevant context separated in different classes. Abstraction, polymorphism, and the use of interfaces help immensely with creating and delivering a clean program.
